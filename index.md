# About the workshop #

Although data is considered to be the “new oil”, pricing data is an exceptionally difficult problem, and for a variety of reasons. For starters, there are economic and legal challenges to pricing, trading, and assessing data. Raw use of data has been invaluable in several sectors such as advertising, healthcare, etc, but often in violation of people’s privacy, which results in ongoing legal uncertainty and challenges. Labeled data has also been extremely valuable for the training of machine learning models (driverless car industry). The resulting importance of data labeling is evidenced by the growth of annotation companies such as Figure8 and Scale.AI, but this poses additional legal and economic questions. What is the fair value to pay those who annotate such data? What about those whose data is annotated? The common economic model of exchanging data (or attention) for services, sometimes known as surveillance capitalism or the attention economy, also raises questions about whether the services provided to users for “free” in exchange for their data and attention are commensurate with the economic value captured from the personal data involved in such exchanges. 
Data marketplaces have been proposed and implemented to formally address some of these concerns with new ways of doing business (such as AWS, Snowflake,Narrative.io, nitrogen.ai), but these marketplaces suffer from a lack of good pricing models. They also fail to maintain the right of the data owners to define how their own data will be used. There have been numerous suggestions for sharing data while maintaining privacy, such as data unions, privacy preserving digital twins, and federated learning, but such new proposals create new legal, economic, and technical challenges.
Likewise, it is technically challenging to define the value of data. While there are several proposals for solving the technical part of data markets and fair pricing, there is not yet a dominant paradigm for pricing data or a consensus about what the relevant valuation factors are. What’s more, technical methods should be guided by fundamental economics and legal requirements. 
This workshop aspires to bring together researchers from the fields (and subfields) of 

- Machine learning and computer science
- Privacy-preserving machine learning methods
- Federated learning
- Data sharing infrastructure
- Economics (and other social sciences)
- Information economics
- Data labor
- Crowdsourcing
- Pricing of machine learning models
- Law and policy
- legal and ethical implications of data trading
- AI ethics
- Data and intellectual property
